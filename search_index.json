목적으로하는 라이브러리입니다.saga는 애플리케이션에서 사이드 이펙트만을 담당하는 별도의 쓰레드와 같은 것으로 보면 됩니다. redux-saga는 리덕스 미들웨어입니다. 따라서 앞서 말한 쓰레드가 메인 애플리케이션에서 일반적인 리덕스 액션을 통해 실행되고, 멈추고, 취소될 수 있게 합니다. 또한 모든 리덕스 애플리케이션의 상태에 접근할 수 있고 리덕스 액션 또한 dispatch 할 수 있습니다.이 라이브러리는 비동기 흐름을 쉽게 읽고, 쓰고, 테스트 할 수 있게 도와주는 ES6의 피쳐인 Generator를 사용합니다.  (만약 Generator와 익숙하지 않다면 여기 몇가지 소개 링크가 있습니다.) Generator를 사용함으로써, 비동기 흐름은 표준 동기식 자바스크립트 코드처럼 보이게 됩니다. (async/await와 비슷한데, generator는 우리가 필요한 몇가지 훌륭한 피쳐들을 더 가지고 있습니다.)당신은 데이터 fetching을 관리하기 위해 redux-thunk를 써본 적이 있을 수 있습니다. redux-thunk와는 대조적으로, 콜백 지옥에 빠지지 않으면서 비동기 흐름들을 쉽게 테스트할 수 있고 액션들을 순수하게 유지합니다.시작하기설치$ npm install --save redux-saga\n혹은$ yarn add redux-saga\n다른 방법으로, HTML 페이지의  태그에 직접 UMD 빌드를 사용할 수 있습니다. 이 섹션을 확인하세요.사용 예제우리가 버튼을 눌렀을 때 원격 서버로부터 한 유저 데이터를 fetch하는 UI를 다룬다고 가정해봅시다.

(지금까진 helloSaga 오직 하나입니다)\n\nSaga 미들웨어를 Redux 스토어에 연결하세요.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n이제 main.js 를 작성해봅시다:\n// ...\nimport { createStore, applyMiddleware } from 'redux'\nimport createSagaMiddleware from 'redux-saga'\n\n// ...\nimport { helloSaga } from './sagas'\n\nconst sagaMiddleware = createSagaMiddleware()\nconst store = createStore(\n  reducer,\n  applyMiddleware(sagaMiddleware)\n)\nsagaMiddleware.run(helloSaga)\n\nconst action = type => store.dispatch({type})\n\n// rest unchanged\n처음에, ./sagas 모듈에서 가져온 우리의 Saga 를 임포트 합니다. 그리고 나서 redux-saga 라이브러리에서 가져온 createSagaMiddleware 팩토리 함수를 사용해서 미들웨어를 만들었죠.\nhelloSaga 를 실행하기 전에, 반드시 applyMiddleware 를 사용해서 미들웨어를 연결해야 sagaMiddleware.run(helloSaga) 를 통해 Saga 를 시작할 수 있습니다.. \n지금까지 우리의 Saga 는 특별하지 않습니다. 이건 단지 로그 메세지만을 남기고 종료될 뿐입니다.\n비동기 호출이제, 오리지널 카운터 데모 가까이 무언가를 추가해봅시다. 비동기 호출을 설명하기 위해 클릭 1초 후 증가되는 또다른 버튼을 추가할겁니다.\n먼저, UI 컴포넌트에 onIncrementAsync 라는 콜백을 넣을겁니다.\nconst Counter = ({ value, onIncrement, onDecrement, onIncrementAsync }) =>\n  \n    {' '}\n    \n      Increment after 1 second\n    \n    \n    \n      Clicked: {value} times\n    \n  \n다음으로, onIncrementAsync 를 스토어 액션에 연결해야 합니다.\nmain.js 모듈을 다음과 같이 수정하겠습니다.\nfunction render() {\n  ReactDOM.render(\n     action('INCREMENT')}\n      onDecrement={() => action('DECREMENT')} \n      onIncrementAsync={() => action('INCREMENT_ASYNC')} />,\n    document.getElementById('root')\n  )\n}\n명심하세요, redux-thunk 와는 달리 우리의 컴포넌트는 순수 액션 오브젝트만 dispatch 할겁니다.\n이제 비동기 호출을 구현하기 위해 또다른 Saga 를 소개해볼까 합니다. \n각각의 INCREMENT_ASYNC 액션에서, 우리는 다음과 같은 작업을 수행할 태스크를 시작하고자 합니다.

Promise 가 미들웨어에 yield 될 때, 미들웨어는 Promise 가 끝날때 까지 Saga 를 일시정지 시킬것 입니다. 위의 예시에서, incrementAsync Saga 는 1초 후에 일어날 delay의 resolve 에 의해 Promise 가 리턴될때 까지 정지되어있을겁니다.\n\n\nPromise 가 한번 resolve 되고 나면, 미들웨어는 Saga 를 다시 작동시키면서, 다음 yield 까지 코드를 실행합니다. 이 예제에서 다음 상태는 미들웨어에게 INCREMENT 액션을 dispach 하게 알려주는  put({type: 'INCREMENT'}) 의 결과 객체가 됩니다.\n\n\nput 은 우리가 이펙트 라고 부르는 예중 하나입니다. 이펙트는 미들웨어에 의해 수행되는 명령을 담고있는 간단한 자바스크립트 객체입니다. 미들웨어가 Saga 에 의해 yield 된 이펙트를 받을때, Saga 는 이펙트가 수행될때까지 정지되어 있을겁니다.\n\n\n정리하자면, incrementAsync Saga 는 delay(1000) 호출에 의해 1초동안 자고있다가, INCREMENT 액션을 dispatch 하게 되는것이죠.\n다음으로, 우리는 watchIncrementAsync 라는 또다른 Saga를 만들었습니다. dispatch된 INCREMENT_ASYNC 액션을 바라보고, 매번 incrementAsync 를 실행하기 위해 redux-saga 패키지가 제공하는 takeEvery 헬퍼 함수를 사용했습니다.\n이제 두개의 Saga가 있네요, 이제 두 Saga 모두 한번에 실행해야할 필요가 생겼습니다, 이 작업을 하려면, 다른 Saga들을 시작해야할 책임이 있는 rootSaga 를 추가해봅시다.자 이제 여기 코드들을 sagas.js 에 추가해보세요.\n\n\n// 모든 Saga들을 한번에 시작하기 위한 하나의 지점입니다.\nexport default function* rootSaga() {\n  yield [\n    incrementAsync(),\n    watchIncrementAsync()\n  ]\n}\n이 Saga는 helloSaga Saga 와 watchIncrementAsync Saga 가 호출된 결과의 배열을 yield 합니다. 이것은 생선된 두 제너레이터가 병렬로 시작된다는것을 의미하죠. 이제 sagaMiddleware.run 를 main.js 의 root Saga에 주입할 일만 남았습니다.\n\n\n// ...\nimport rootSaga from './sagas'\n\nconst sagaMiddleware = createSagaMiddleware()\nconst store = ...\nsagaMiddleware.run(rootSaga)\n\n// ...\n테스트이제 우리의 incrementAsync Saga 가 바람직한 태스크를 수행하는지 확실하게 해야겠죠? 테스트를 만들어 봅시다.\nsagas.spec.js 파일을 만듭시다.\nimport test from 'tape';\n\nimport { incrementAsync } from './sagas'\n\ntest('incrementAsync Saga test', (assert) => {\n  const gen = incrementAsync()\n\n  // now what ?\n});\nincrementAsync 는 제너레이터 함수입니다. 이것을 실행하면, 이터레이터 오브젝트를 반환하고, 이터레이터의 next 메소드는 다음과 같은 모양을 가진 객체를 돌려줍니다. \ngen.next() // => { done: boolean, value: any }\nvalue 필드는 yield 된 표현식을 포함합니다. yield 다음 표현식의 결과 같은 것 말이죠.\ndone 필드는 아직 yield 표현이 남아있는지, 아니면 제너레이터가 종료되었는지 가리킵니다.\nincrementAsync 로 예를 들자면, 제너레이터는 두개의 값을 연속으로 yield 합니다.\nyield delay(1000)\n\nyield put({type: 'INCREMENT'})\n\n그래서 우리가 제너레이터의 next 메소드를 세번 연속하여 부른다면, 다음과 같은 결과값을 얻게 됩니다.\ngen.next() // => { done: false, value:  }\ngen.next() // => { done: false, value:  }\ngen.next() // => { done: true, value: undefined }\n처음 두개 호출은 yield 표현의 결과를 돌려줍니다. 3번째 호출은 더이상 yield 가 없기 때문에 done 필드는 true 로 설정되고, incrementAsync 제너레이터가 아무것도 리턴하지 않기 때문에 value 필드는 undefined 로 설정됩니다.\n자 이제, incrementAsync 안에서 로직을 테스트하기 위해, 돌려받은 제너레이터를 반복하고, 제너레이터에 의해 yield 된 값들을 간단히 체크할겁니다.\nimport test from 'tape';\n\nimport { incrementAsync } from './sagas'\n\ntest('incrementAsync Saga test', (assert) => {\n  const gen = incrementAsync()\n\n  assert.deepEqual(\n    gen.next(),\n    { done: false, value: ??? },\n    'incrementAsync should return a Promise that will resolve after 1 second'\n  )\n});\n하지만 Promise 에선 비교연산을 할 수 없는데 어떻게 delay 의 리턴값을 테스트 하죠?  만약 delay 가 평범한 값을 돌려준다면 테스트하기 쉬울텐데요..\nredux-saga 는 위의 고민을 해결할 방법을 제시하고 있습니다. incrementAsync 에서 delay(1000) 을 직접적으로 호출하는것 대신, 우린 간접적으로 호출할겁니다.\n// ...\nimport { delay } from 'redux-saga'\nimport { put, call, takeEvery } from 'redux-saga/effects'\n\nexport function* incrementAsync() {\n  // use the call Effect\n  yield call(delay, 1000)\n  yield put({ type: 'INCREMENT' })\n}\nyield delay(1000) 대신 yield call(delay, 1000) 를 하고있습니다, 무엇이 달라졌는지 보이시나요?\n첫번째 경우에서, delay(1000) yield 구문은 next 의 호출자로 넘겨지기 전에 실행되고, (여기서 호출자는 미들웨어가 되거나, 제너레이터 함수를 실행하고 리턴된 제너레이터를 넘어 반복하는 테스트코드가 되어야 합니다.)  호출자가 얻게 되는것은 Promise 입니다. 아래 코드를 참고하세요.\n\n\n두번째 경우에선, call(delay, 1000) yield 구문은 next 의 호출자에게 넘겨지게 됩니다. put 과 유사한 call 은 미들웨어에게 주어진 함수와 인자들을 실행하라는 명령을 하는 이펙트를 리턴합니다.\n사실, put 과 call 은 스스로 어떤 dispatch 나 비동기적인 호출을 하지 않습니다. 그들은 단지 순수한 자바스크립트 객체를 돌려줄 뿐입니다.\n\n\nput({type: 'INCREMENT'}) // => { PUT: {type: 'INCREMENT'} }\ncall(delay, 1000)        // => { CALL: {fn: delay, args: [1000]}}\n무슨일이 일어날까요? 미들웨어는 각각의 yield 된 이펙트들을 검사한뒤, 어떻게 이펙트를 수행할지 결정합니다. 만약 이펙트의 타입이 PUT 이라면, 미들웨어는 스토어에 액션을 dispatch 할것입니다. CALL 인 경우엔 주어진 함수를 실행하게 되는것 이고요.\n\n\n이 이펙트생성과 이펙트 실행의 분리는 제너레이터를 놀랍게도 쉽게 테스트가 가능하도록 만듭니다.\nimport test from 'tape';\n\nimport { put, call } from 'redux-saga/effects'\nimport { delay } from 'redux-saga'\nimport { incrementAsync } from './sagas'\n\ntest('incrementAsync Saga test', (assert) => {\n  const gen = incrementAsync()\n\n  assert.deepEqual(\n    gen.next().value,\n    call(delay, 1000),\n    'incrementAsync Saga must call delay(1000)'\n  )\n\n  assert.deepEqual(\n    gen.next().value,\n    put({type: 'INCREMENT'}),\n    'incrementAsync Saga must dispatch an INCREMENT action'\n  )\n\n  assert.deepEqual(\n    gen.next(),\n    { done: true, value: undefined },\n    'incrementAsync Saga must be done'\n  )\n\n  assert.end()\n});\nput 과 call 이 순수 객체를 반환하기 때문에, 테스트 코드에서 같은 함수들을 재사용할수 있게 되었고, incrementAsync 의 로직을 테스트 하기 위해 단순히 제너레이터를 반복하고 값에 대해 deepEqual 테스트를 할수 있게 되었습니다.\n\n\n위의 테스트를 진행하기 위한 코드입니다:\n$ npm test\n이 테스트는 콘솔에 결과를 보고해야 합니다.\n"},"introduction/SagaBackground.html":{"url":"introduction/SagaBackground.html","title":"배경지식","keywords":"","body":"배경지식진행중여기 유용한 링크들이 있습니다.링크Saga 패턴 적용하기 (Youtube video) By Caitie McCaffrey\n\nOriginal paper By Hector Garcia-Molina & Kenneth Salem\n\nA Saga on Sagas from MSDN site\n\n"},"basics/":{"url":"basics/","title":"기본","keywords":"","body":"기본헬퍼 함수\n\n효과\n\n액션 확산\n\n에러 핸들링\n\n이펙트 추상화\n\n"},"basics/UsingSagaHelpers.html":{"url":"basics/UsingSagaHelpers.html","title":"헬퍼 함수","keywords":"","body":"헬퍼 함수redux-saga 는 스토어에 몇몇 지정된 액션들이 dispatch 되었을때 태스크를 만들기 위해 내부 함수들을 감싸는 몇몇 헬퍼 이펙트들을 제공합니다.\n헬퍼 함수들은 저레벨 API의 상단에 내장되어있습니다. 우리는 심화 섹션에서 어떻게 이 함수들이 구현될 수 있는지 볼겁니다.\n첫번쨰 헬버 함수는 redux-thunk 과 비슷한 행동을 제공하는 아주 유명한 takeEvery 함수 입니다\n흔한 AJAX 예제와 설명해보겠습니다. 클릭할때 마다 FETCH_REQUESTED 액션을 dispatch 하는 버튼이 있고,\n서버로부터 받은 데이터를 fetch 시키게 하는 어떤 태스크를 실행해서 이 액션을 핸들링 해봅시다.\n\n먼저 비동기 액션을 수행하는 태스크를 만듭시다.\nimport { call, put } from 'redux-saga/effects'\n\nexport function* fetchData(action) {\n   try {\n      const data = yield call(Api.fetchUser, action.payload.url)\n      yield put({type: \"FETCH_SUCCEEDED\", data})\n   } catch (error) {\n      yield put({type: \"FETCH_FAILED\", error})\n   }\n}\n위의 태스크를 각각의 FETCH_REQUESTED 액션마다 실행하려면..:\nimport { takeEvery } from 'redux-saga/effects'\n\nfunction* watchFetchData() {\n  yield takeEvery('FETCH_REQUESTED', fetchData)\n}\n위 예제에서 takeEvery 는 여러개의 fetchData 인스턴스를 동시에 시작되게 합니다.\n한개 혹은 여러개의 아직 종료되지 않은 fetchData 태스크들이 있더라도 새로운 fetchData 태스크를 시작할 수 있습니다.\n\n만약 마지막으로 발생된 리퀘스트의 응답만 얻고싶다면, takeLatest 헬퍼를 사용할 수 있습니다.

Saga 로직을 표현하기 위해서 우리는 제너레이터로부터 온 순수 자바스크립트 객체를 yield 합니다. 이런 오브젝트들을 이펙트 라고 부릅니다. 이펙트는 미들웨어에 의해 해석되는 몇몇 정보들을 담고있는 간단한 객체입니다. 어떤 기능을 수행하기 위해 미들웨어에 전해지는 명령(스토어에 액션을 dispatch 하는 행위나 비동기 함수를 호출하는 등)이라고 볼수 있죠.\n\n\n이펙트들을 만들기 위해서, redux-saga/effects 패키지에 있는 라이브러리들이 제공하는 함수들을 사용합니다.\n이 섹션에서, 몇몇 기본 이펙트들을 소개하겠습니다. 어떻게 Saga 가 테스트되기 쉬운지 관찰해보세요.\nSagas 는 여러 형식으로 이펙트들을 yield 할 수 있습니다. 가장 쉬운 방법은 Promise 를 yield 하는것입니다.\n예를 들어, PRODUCTS_REQUESTED 라는 액션을 보고있는 Saga 가 있다고 가정해봅시다, 액션이 매칭될때 마다, 서버로부터 온 상품 리스트를 가지고 오는 태스크를 실행합니다.\nimport { takeEvery } from 'redux-saga/effects'\nimport Api from './path/to/api'\n\nfunction* watchFetchProducts() {\n  yield takeEvery('PRODUCTS_REQUESTED', fetchProducts)\n}\n\nfunction* fetchProducts() {\n  const products = yield Api.fetch('/products')\n  console.log(products)\n}\n예제는 제너레이터 내부에서 Api.fetch 를 직접적으로 호출하고 있습니다.

This mimics somewhat the behavior of redux-thunk: each time a Component, for example, invokes a fetchProducts Action Creator, the Action Creator will dispatch a thunk to execute the control flow.In reality, takeEvery is just a wrapper effect for internal helper function built on top of the lower level and more powerful API. In this section we'll see a new Effect, take, which makes it possible to build complex control flow by allowing total control of the action observation process.A simple loggerLet's take a simple example of a Saga that watches all actions dispatched to the store and logs them to the console.Using takeEvery('*') (with the wildcard * pattern) we can catch all dispatched actions regardless of their types.import { select, takeEvery } from 'redux-saga/effects'\n\nfunction* watchAndLog() {\n  yield takeEvery('*', function* logger(action) {\n    const state = yield select()\n\n    console.log('action', action)\n    console.log('state after', state)\n  })\n}\nNow let's see how to use the take Effect to implement the same flow as aboveimport { select, take } from 'redux-saga/effects'\n\nfunction* watchAndLog() {\n  while (true) {\n    const action = yield take('*')\n    const state = yield select()\n\n    console.log('action', action)\n    console.log('state after', state)\n  }\n}\nThe take is just like call and put we saw earlier. It creates another command object that tells the middleware to wait for a specific action. The resulting behavior of the call Effect is the same as when the middleware suspends the Generator until a Promise resolves. In the take case it'll suspend the Generator until a matching action is dispatched. In the above example watchAndLog is suspended until any action is dispatched.Note how we're running an endless loop while (true). Remember this is a Generator function, which doesn't have a run-to-completion behavior. Our Generator will block on each iteration waiting for an action to happen.Using take has a subtle impact on how we write our code. In the case of takeEvery the invoked tasks have no control on when they'll be called. They will be invoked again and again on each matching action. They also have no control on when to stop the observation.In the case of take the control is inverted. Instead of the actions being pushed to the handler tasks, the Saga is pulling the action by itself. It looks as if the Saga is performing a normal function call action = getNextAction() which will resolve when the action is dispatched.This inversion of control allows us to implement control flows that are non-trivial to do with the traditional push approach.As a simple example, suppose that in our Todo application, we want to watch user actions and show a congratulation message after the user has created his first three todos.import { take, put } from 'redux-saga/effects'\n\nfunction* watchFirstThreeTodosCreation() {\n  for (let i = 0; i \nInstead of a while (true) we're running a for loop which will iterate only three times. After taking the first three TODO_CREATED actions, watchFirstThreeTodosCreation will cause the application to display a congratulation message then terminate. This means the Generator will be garbage collected and no more observation will take place.Another benefit of the pull approach is that we can describe our control flow using a familiar synchronous style. For example, suppose we want to implement a login flow with 2 actions LOGIN and LOGOUT. Using takeEvery (or redux-thunk) we'll have to write 2 separate tasks (or thunks): one for LOGIN and the other for LOGOUT.The result is that our logic is now spread in 2 places. In order for someone reading our code to understand what's going on, he has to read the source of the 2 handlers and make the link between the logic in both. It means he has to rebuild the model of the flow in his head by rearranging mentally the logic placed in various places of the code in the correct order.Using the pull model we can write our flow in the same place instead of handling the same action repeatedly.function* loginFlow() {\n  while (true) {\n    yield take('LOGIN')\n    // ... perform the login logic\n    yield take('LOGOUT')\n    // ... perform the logout logic\n  }\n}\nThe loginFlow Saga more clearly conveys the expected action sequence. It knows that the LOGIN action should always be followed by a LOGOUT action and that LOGOUT is always followed by a LOGIN (a good UI should always enforce a consistent order of the actions, by hiding or disabling unexpected action)."},"advanced/NonBlockingCalls.html":{"url":"advanced/NonBlockingCalls.html","title":"Non blocking calls","keywords":"","body":"Non-blocking callsIn the previous section, we saw how the take Effect allows us to better describe a non-trivial flow in a central place.Revisiting the login flow example:function* loginFlow() {\n  while (true) {\n    yield take('LOGIN')\n    // ... perform the login logic\n    yield take('LOGOUT')\n    // ... perform the logout logic\n  }\n}\nLet's complete the example and implement the actual login/logout logic. Suppose we have an API which permits us to authorize the user on a remote server. If the authorization is successful, the server will return an authorization token which will be stored by our application using DOM storage (assume our API provides another service for DOM storage).When the user logs out, we'll simply delete the authorization token stored previously.First trySo far we have all needed Effects in order to implement the above flow. We can wait for specific actions in the store using the take Effect. We can make asynchronous calls using the call Effect. Finally, we can dispatch actions to the store using the put Effect.So let's give it a try:Note: the code below has a subtle issue. Make sure to read the section until the end.import { take, call, put } from 'redux-saga/effects'\nimport Api from '...'\n\nfunction* authorize(user, password) {\n  try {\n    const token = yield call(Api.authorize, user, password)\n    yield put({type: 'LOGIN_SUCCESS', token})\n    return token\n  } catch(error) {\n    yield put({type: 'LOGIN_ERROR', error})\n  }\n}\n\nfunction* loginFlow() {\n  while (true) {\n    const {user, password} = yield take('LOGIN_REQUEST')\n    const token = yield call(authorize, user, password)\n    if (token) {\n      yield call(Api.storeItem, {token})\n      yield take('LOGOUT')\n      yield call(Api.clearItem, 'token')\n    }\n  }\n}\nFirst we created a separate Generator authorize which will perform the actual API call and notify the Store upon success.The loginFlow implements its entire flow inside a while (true) loop, which means once we reach the last step in the flow (LOGOUT) we start a new iteration by waiting for a new LOGIN_REQUEST action.loginFlow first waits for a LOGIN_REQUEST action. Then retrieves the credentials in the action payload (user and password) and makes a call to the authorize task.As you noted, call isn't only for invoking functions returning Promises. We can also use it to invoke other Generator functions. In the above example, loginFlow will wait for authorize until it terminates and returns (i.e. after performing the api call, dispatching the action and then returning the token to loginFlow).If the API call succeeds, authorize will dispatch a LOGIN_SUCCESS action then return the fetched token. If it results in an error,  it'll dispatch a LOGIN_ERROR action.If the call to authorize is successful, loginFlow will store the returned token in the DOM storage and wait for a LOGOUT action. When the user logouts, we remove the stored token and wait for a new user login.In the case of authorize failed, it'll return an undefined value, which will cause loginFlow to skip the previous process and wait for a new LOGIN_REQUEST action.Observe how the entire logic is stored in one place. A new developer reading our code doesn't have to travel between various places in order to understand the control flow. It's like reading a synchronous algorithm: steps are laid out in their natural order. And we have functions which call other functions and wait for their results.But there is still a subtle issue with the above approachSuppose that when the loginFlow is waiting for the following call to resolve:function* loginFlow() {\n  while (true) {\n    // ...\n    try {\n      const token = yield call(authorize, user, password)\n      // ...\n    }\n    // ...\n  }\n}\nThe user clicks on the Logout button causing a LOGOUT action to be dispatched.The following example illustrates the hypothetical sequence of the events:UI                              loginFlow\n--------------------------------------------------------\nLOGIN_REQUEST...................call authorize.......... waiting to resolve\n........................................................\n........................................................\nLOGOUT.................................................. missed!\n........................................................\n................................authorize returned...... dispatch a `LOGIN_SUCCESS`!!\n........................................................\nWhen loginFlow is blocked on the authorize call, an eventual LOGOUT occurring in between the call and the response will be missed, because loginFlow hasn't yet performed the yield take('LOGOUT').The problem with the above code is that call is a blocking Effect. i.e. the Generator can't perform/handle anything else until the call terminates. But in our case we do not only want loginFlow to execute the authorization call, but also watch for an eventual LOGOUT action that may occur in the middle of this call. That's because LOGOUT is concurrent to the authorize call.So what's needed is some way to start authorize without blocking so loginFlow can continue and watch for an eventual/concurrent LOGOUT action.To express non-blocking calls, the library provides another Effect: fork. When we fork a task, the task is started in the background and the caller can continue its flow without waiting for the forked task to terminate.So in order for loginFlow to not miss a concurrent LOGOUT, we must not call the authorize task, instead we have to fork it.import { fork, call, take, put } from 'redux-saga/effects'\n\nfunction* loginFlow() {\n  while (true) {\n    ...\n    try {\n      // non-blocking call, what's the returned value here ?\n      const ?? = yield fork(authorize, user, password)\n      ...\n    }\n    ...\n  }\n}\nThe issue now is since our authorize action is started in the background, we can't get the token result (because we'd have to wait for it). So we need to move the token storage operation into the authorize task.import { fork, call, take, put } from 'redux-saga/effects'\nimport Api from '...'\n\nfunction* authorize(user, password) {\n  try {\n    const token = yield call(Api.authorize, user, password)\n    yield put({type: 'LOGIN_SUCCESS', token})\n    yield call(Api.storeItem, {token})\n  } catch(error) {\n    yield put({type: 'LOGIN_ERROR', error})\n  }\n}\n\nfunction* loginFlow() {\n  while (true) {\n    const {user, password} = yield take('LOGIN_REQUEST')\n    yield fork(authorize, user, password)\n    yield take(['LOGOUT', 'LOGIN_ERROR'])\n    yield call(Api.clearItem, 'token')\n  }\n}\nWe're also doing yield take(['LOGOUT', 'LOGIN_ERROR']). It means we are watching for 2 concurrent actions:If the authorize task succeeds before the user logs out, it'll dispatch a LOGIN_SUCCESS action, then terminate. Our loginFlow saga will then wait only for a future LOGOUT action (because LOGIN_ERROR will never happen).\nIf the authorize fails before the user logs out, it will dispatch a LOGIN_ERROR action, then terminate. So loginFlow will take the LOGIN_ERROR before the LOGOUT then it will enter in a another while iteration and will wait for the next LOGIN_REQUEST action.\nIf the user logs out before the authorize terminate, then loginFlow will take a LOGOUT action and also wait for the next LOGIN_REQUEST.\nNote the call for Api.clearItem is supposed to be idempotent. It'll have no effect if no token was stored by the authorize call. loginFlow makes sure no token will be in the storage before waiting for the next login.But we're not yet done. If we take a LOGOUT in the middle of an API call, we have to cancel the authorize process, otherwise we'll have 2 concurrent tasks evolving in parallel: The authorize task will continue running and upon a successful (resp. failed) result, will dispatch a LOGIN_SUCCESS (resp. a LOGIN_ERROR) action leading to an inconsistent state.In order to cancel a forked task, we use a dedicated Effect cancelimport { take, put, call, fork, cancel } from 'redux-saga/effects'\n\n// ...\n\nfunction* loginFlow() {\n  while (true) {\n    const {user, password} = yield take('LOGIN_REQUEST')\n    // fork return a Task object\n    const task = yield fork(authorize, user, password)\n    const action = yield take(['LOGOUT', 'LOGIN_ERROR'])\n    if (action.type === 'LOGOUT')\n      yield cancel(task)\n    yield call(Api.clearItem, 'token')\n  }\n}\nyield fork results in a Task Object. We assign the returned object into a local constant task. Later if we take a LOGOUT action, we pass that task to the cancel Effect. If the task is still running, it'll be aborted. If the task has already completed then nothing will happen and the cancellation will result in a no-op. And finally, if the task completed with an error, then we do nothing, because we know the task already completed.We are almost done (concurrency is not that easy; you have to take it seriously).Suppose that when we receive a LOGIN_REQUEST action, our reducer sets some isLoginPending flag to true so it can display some message or spinner in the UI. If we get a LOGOUT in the middle of an API call and abort the task by simply killing it (i.e. the task is stopped right away), then we may end up again with an inconsistent state. We'll still have isLoginPending set to true and our reducer will be waiting for an outcome action (LOGIN_SUCCESS or LOGIN_ERROR).Fortunately, the cancel Effect won't brutally kill our authorize task, it'll instead give it a chance to perform its cleanup logic. The cancelled task can handle any cancellation logic (as well as any other type of completion) in its finally block. Since a finally block execute on any type of completion (normal return, error, or forced cancellation), there is an Effect cancelled which you can use if you want handle cancellation in a special way:import { take, call, put, cancelled } from 'redux-saga/effects'\nimport Api from '...'\n\nfunction* authorize(user, password) {\n  try {\n    const token = yield call(Api.authorize, user, password)\n    yield put({type: 'LOGIN_SUCCESS', token})\n    yield call(Api.storeItem, {token})\n    return token\n  } catch(error) {\n    yield put({type: 'LOGIN_ERROR', error})\n  } finally {\n    if (yield cancelled()) {\n      // ... put special cancellation handling code here\n    }\n  }\n}\nYou may have noticed that we haven't done anything about clearing our isLoginPending state. For that, there are at least two possible solutions:dispatch a dedicated action RESET_LOGIN_PENDING\n\nmore simply, make the reducer clear the isLoginPending on a LOGOUT action\n\n"},"advanced/RunningTasksInParallel.html":{"url":"advanced/RunningTasksInParallel.html","title":"Running tasks in parallel","keywords":"","body":"Running Tasks In ParallelThe yield statement is great for representing asynchronous control flow in a simple and linear style, but we also need to do things in parallel.

When yielding a call to a generator, the Saga will wait for the generator to terminate before progressing, then resume with the returned value (or throws if an error propagates from the subtask).function* fetchPosts() {\n  yield put(actions.requestPosts())\n  const products = yield call(fetchApi, '/products')\n  yield put(actions.receivePosts(products))\n}\n\nfunction* watchFetch() {\n  while (yield take(FETCH_POSTS)) {\n    yield call(fetchPosts) // waits for the fetchPosts task to terminate\n  }\n}\nYielding to an array of nested generators will start all the sub-generators in parallel, wait\nfor them to finish, then resume with all the resultsfunction* mainSaga(getState) {\n  const results = yield [call(task1), call(task2), ...]\n  yield put(showResults(results))\n}\nIn fact, yielding Sagas is no different than yielding other effects (future actions, timeouts, etc). This means you can combine those Sagas with all the other types using the effect combinators.For example, you may want the user to finish some game in a limited amount of time:function* game(getState) {\n  let finished\n  while (!finished) {\n    // has to finish in 60 seconds\n    const {score, timeout} = yield race({\n      score: call(play, getState),\n      timeout: call(delay, 60000)\n    })\n\n    if (!timeout) {\n      finished = true\n      yield put(showScore(score))\n    }\n  }\n}\n"},"advanced/TaskCancellation.html":{"url":"advanced/TaskCancellation.html","title":"Task cancellation","keywords":"","body":"Task cancellationWe saw already an example of cancellation in the Non blocking calls section. In this section we'll review cancellation in more detail.Once a task is forked, you can abort its execution using yield cancel(task).To see how it works, let's consider a simple example: A background sync which can be started/stopped by some UI commands. Upon receiving a START_BACKGROUND_SYNC action, we fork a background task that will periodically sync some data from a remote server.The task will execute continually until a STOP_BACKGROUND_SYNC action is triggered. Then we cancel the background task and wait again for the next START_BACKGROUND_SYNC action.import { take, put, call, fork, cancel, cancelled } from 'redux-saga/effects'\nimport { delay } from 'redux-saga'\nimport { someApi, actions } from 'somewhere'\n\nfunction* bgSync() {\n  try {\n    while (true) {\n      yield put(actions.requestStart())\n      const result = yield call(someApi)\n      yield put(actions.requestSuccess(result))\n      yield call(delay, 5000)\n    }\n  } finally {\n    if (yield cancelled())\n      yield put(actions.requestFailure('Sync cancelled!'))\n  }\n}\n\nfunction* main() {\n  while ( yield take(START_BACKGROUND_SYNC) ) {\n    // starts the task in the background\n    const bgSyncTask = yield fork(bgSync)\n\n    // wait for the user stop action\n    yield take(STOP_BACKGROUND_SYNC)\n    // user clicked stop. cancel the background task\n    // this will cause the forked bgSync task to jump into its finally block\n    yield cancel(bgSyncTask)\n  }\n}\nIn the above example, cancellation of bgSyncTask will cause the Generator to jump to the finally block. Here you can use yield cancelled() to check if the Generator has been cancelled or not.Cancelling a running task will also cancel the current Effect where the task is blocked at the moment of cancellation.For example, suppose that at a certain point in an application's lifetime, we have this pending call chain:function* main() {\n  const task = yield fork(subtask)\n  ...\n  // later\n  yield cancel(task)\n}\n\nfunction* subtask() {\n  ...\n  yield call(subtask2) // currently blocked on this call\n  ...\n}\n\nfunction* subtask2() {\n  ...\n  yield call(someApi) // currently blocked on this call\n  ...\n}\nyield cancel(task) triggers a cancellation on subtask, which in turn triggers a cancellation on subtask2.So we saw that Cancellation propagates downward (in contrast returned values and uncaught errors propagates upward). You can see it as a contract between the caller (which invokes the async operation) and the callee (the invoked operation). The callee is responsible for performing the operation. If it has completed (either success or error) the outcome propagates up to its caller and eventually to the caller of the caller and so on. That is, callees are responsible for completing the flow.Now if the callee is still pending and the caller decides to cancel the operation, it triggers a kind of a signal that propagates down to the callee (and possibly to any deep operations called by the callee itself). All deeply pending operations will be cancelled.There is another direction where the cancellation propagates to as well: the joiners of a task (those blocked on a yield join(task)) will also be cancelled if the joined task is cancelled. Similarly, any potential callers of those joiners will be cancelled as well (because they are blocked on an operation that has been cancelled from outside).Testing generators with fork effectWhen fork is called it starts the task in the background and also returns task object like we have learned previously. When testing this we have to use utility function createMockTask. Object returned from this function should be passed to next next call after fork test. Mock task can then be passed to cancel for example. Here is test for main generator which is on top of this page.import { createMockTask } from 'redux-saga/utils';\n\ndescribe('main', () => {\n  const generator = main();\n\n  it('waits for start action', () => {\n    const expectedYield = take(START_BACKGROUND_SYNC);\n    expect(generator.next().value).to.deep.equal(expectedYield);\n  });\n\n  it('forks the service', () => {\n    const expectedYield = fork(bgSync);\n    expect(generator.next().value).to.deep.equal(expectedYield);\n  });\n\n  it('waits for stop action and then cancels the service', () => {\n    const mockTask = createMockTask();\n\n    const expectedTakeYield = take(STOP_BACKGROUND_SYNC);\n    expect(generator.next(mockTask).value).to.deep.equal(expectedTakeYield);\n\n    const expectedCancelYield = cancel(mockTask);\n    expect(generator.next().value).to.deep.equal(expectedCancelYield);\n  });\n});\nYou can also use mock task's functions setRunning, setResult and setError to set mock task's state. For example mockTask.setRunning(false).NoteIt's important to remember that yield cancel(task) doesn't wait for the cancelled task to finish (i.e. to perform its finally block). The cancel effect behaves like fork. It returns as soon as the cancel was initiated. Once cancelled, a task should normally return as soon as it finishes its cleanup logic.Automatic cancellationBesides manual cancellation there are cases where cancellation is triggered automaticallyIn a race effect. All race competitors, except the winner, are automatically cancelled.\nIn a parallel effect (yield [...]). The parallel effect is rejected as soon as one of the sub-effects is rejected (as implied by Promise.all). In this case, all the other sub-effects are automatically cancelled.\n"},"advanced/ForkModel.html":{"url":"advanced/ForkModel.html","title":"redux-saga's fork model","keywords":"","body":"redux-saga's fork modelIn redux-saga you can dynamically fork tasks that execute in the background using 2 Effectsfork is used to create attached forks\n\nspawn is used to create detached forks\n\nAttached forks (using fork)Attached forks remains attached to their parent by the following rulesCompletionA Saga terminates only after\nIt terminates its own body of instructions\n\nAll attached forks are themselves terminated\n\n\nFor example say we have the followingimport { delay } from 'redux-saga'\nimport { fork, call, put } from 'redux-saga/effects'\nimport api from './somewhere/api' // app specific\nimport { receiveData } from './somewhere/actions' // app specific\n\nfunction* fetchAll() {\n  const task1 = yield fork(fetchResource, 'users')\n  const task2 = yield fork(fetchResource, 'comments')\n  yield call(delay, 1000)\n}\n\nfunction* fetchResource(resource) {\n  const {data} = yield call(api.fetch, resource)\n  yield put(receiveData(data))\n}\n\nfunction* main() {\n  yield call(fetchAll)\n}\ncall(fetchAll) will terminate after:The fetchAll body itself terminates, this means all 3 effects are performed. Since fork effects are non blocking, the\ntask will block on call(delay, 1000)\nThe 2 forked tasks terminate, i.e. after fetching the required resources and putting the corresponding receiveData actions\nSo the whole task will block until a delay of 1000 millisecond passed and both task1 and task2 finished their business.Say for example, the delay of 1000 milliseconds elapsed and the 2 tasks hasn't yet finished, then fetchAll will still wait\nfor all forked tasks to finish before terminating the whole task.The attentive reader might have noticed the fetchAll saga could be rewritten using the parallel Effectfunction* fetchAll() {\n  yield [\n    call(fetchResource, 'users'),     // task1\n    call(fetchResource, 'comments'),  // task2,\n    call(delay, 1000)\n  ]\n}\nIn fact, attached forks shares the same semantics with the parallel Effect:We're executing tasks in parallel\n\nThe parent will terminate after all launched tasks terminate  \n\nAnd this applies for all other semantics as well (error and cancellation propagation). You can understand how\nattached forks behave by simply considering it as a dynamic parallel Effect.Error propagationFollowing the same analogy, Let's examine in detail how errors are handled in parallel Effectsfor example, let's say we have this Effectyield [\n  call(fetchResource, 'users'),\n  call(fetchResource, 'comments'),\n  call(delay, 1000)\n]\nThe above effect will fail as soon as any one of the 3 child Effects fails. Furthermore, the uncaught error will cause\nthe parallel Effect to cancel all the other pending Effects. So for example if call(fetchResource), 'users') raises an\nuncaught error, the parallel Effect will cancel the 2 other tasks (if they are still pending) then aborts itself with the\nsame error from the failed call.Similarly for attached forks, a Saga aborts as soon asIts main body of instructions throws an error\nAn uncaught error was raised by one of its attached forks\nSo in the previous example//... imports\n\nfunction* fetchAll() {\n  const task1 = yield fork(fetchResource, 'users')\n  const task2 = yield fork(fetchResource, 'comments')\n  yield call(delay, 1000)\n}\n\nfunction* fetchResource(resource) {\n  const {data} = yield call(api.fetch, resource)\n  yield put(receiveData(data))\n}\n\nfunction* main() {\n  try {\n    yield call(fetchAll)\n  } catch (e) {\n    // handle fetchAll errors\n  }\n}\nIf at a moment, for example, fetchAll is blocked on the call(delay, 1000) Effect, and say, task1 failed, then the whole\nfetchAll task will fail causingCancellation of all other pending tasks. This includes:The main task (the body of fetchAll): cancelling it means cancelling the current Effect call(delay, 1000)  \n\nThe other forked tasks which are still pending. i.e. task2 in our example.\n\n\nThe call(fetchAll) will raise itself an error which will be caught in the catch body of main\nNote we're able to catch the error from call(fetchAll) inside main only because we're using a blocking call. And that\nwe can't catch the error directly from fetchAll. This a rule of thumb, you can't catch errors from forked tasks. A failure\nin an attached fork will cause the forking parent to abort (Just like there is no way to catch an error inside a parallel Effect, only from\noutside by blocking on the parallel Effect).CancellationCancelling a Saga causes the cancellation of:The main task this means cancelling the current Effect where the Saga is blocked\nAll attached forks that are still executing\nWIPDetached forks (using spawn)Detached forks live in their own execution context. A parent doesn't wait for detached forks to terminate. Uncaught\nerrors from spawned tasks are not bubbled up to the parent.

Channels generalize those Effects to communicate with external event sources or between Sagas themselves. They can also be used to queue specific actions from the Store.In this section, we'll see:How to use the yield actionChannel Effect to buffer specific actions from the Store.\nHow to use the eventChannel factory function to connect take Effects to external event sources.\nHow to create a channel using the generic channel factory function and use it in take/put Effects to\ncommunicate between two Sagas.\nUsing the actionChannel EffectLet's review the canonical example:import { take, fork, ... } from 'redux-saga/effects'\n\nfunction* watchRequests() {\n  while (true) {\n    const {payload} = yield take('REQUEST')\n    yield fork(handleRequest, payload)\n  }\n}\n\nfunction* handleRequest(payload) { ... }\nThe above example illustrates the typical watch-and-fork pattern. The watchRequests saga is using fork to avoid blocking and thus not missing any action from the store. A handleRequest task is created on each REQUEST action. So if there are many actions fired at a rapid rate there can be many handleRequest tasks executing concurrently.Imagine now that our requirement is as follows: we want to process REQUEST serially. If we have at any moment four actions, we want to handle the first REQUEST action, then only after finishing this action we process the second action and so on...So we want to queue all non-processed actions, and once we're done with processing the current request, we get the next message from the queue.Redux-Saga provides a little helper Effect actionChannel, which can handle this for us. Let's see how we can rewrite the previous example with it:import { take, actionChannel, call, ... } from 'redux-saga/effects'\n\nfunction* watchRequests() {\n  // 1- Create a channel for request actions\n  const requestChan = yield actionChannel('REQUEST')\n  while (true) {\n    // 2- take from the channel\n    const {payload} = yield take(requestChan)\n    // 3- Note that we're using a blocking call\n    yield call(handleRequest, payload)\n  }\n}\n\nfunction* handleRequest(payload) { ... }\nThe first thing is to create the action channel. We use yield actionChannel(pattern) where pattern is interpreted using the same rules we mentioned previously with take(pattern). The difference between the 2 forms is that actionChannel can buffer incoming messages if the Saga is not yet ready to take them (e.g. blocked on an API call).Next is the yield take(requestChan). Besides usage with a pattern to take specific actions from the Redux Store, take can also be used with channels (above we created a channel object from specific Redux actions). The take will block the Saga until a message is available on the channel. The take may also resume immediately if there is a message stored in the underlying buffer.The important thing to note is how we're using a blocking call. The Saga will remain blocked until call(handleRequest) returns. But meanwhile, if other REQUEST actions are dispatched while the Saga is still blocked, they will queued internally by requestChan. When the Saga resumes from call(handleRequest) and executes the next yield take(requestChan), the take will resolve with the queued message.By default, actionChannel buffers all incoming messages without limit. If you want a more control over the buffering, you can supply a Buffer argument to the effect creator. Redux-Saga provides some common buffers (none, dropping, sliding) but you can also supply your own buffer implementation. See API docs for more details.For example if you want to handle only the most recent five items you can use:import { buffers } from 'redux-saga'\nimport { actionChannel } from 'redux-saga/effects'\n\nfunction* watchRequests() {\n  const requestChan = yield actionChannel('REQUEST', buffers.sliding(5))\n  ...\n}\nUsing the eventChannel factory to connect to external eventsLike actionChannel (Effect), eventChannel (a factory function, not an Effect) creates a Channel for events but from event sources other than the Redux Store.This simple example creates a Channel from an interval:import { eventChannel, END } from 'redux-saga'\n\nfunction countdown(secs) {\n  return eventChannel(emitter => {\n      const iv = setInterval(() => {\n        secs -= 1\n        if (secs > 0) {\n          emitter(secs)\n        } else {\n          // this causes the channel to close\n          emitter(END)\n        }\n      }, 1000);\n      // The subscriber must return an unsubscribe function\n      return () => {\n        clearInterval(iv)\n      }\n    }\n  )\n}\nThe first argument in eventChannel is a subscriber function. The role of the subscriber is to initialize the external event source (above using setInterval), then routes all incoming events from the source to the channel by invoking the supplied emitter. In the above example we're invoking emitter on each second.Note: You need to sanitize your event sources as to not pass null or undefined through the event channel. While it's fine to pass numbers through, we'd recommend structuring your event channel data like your redux actions. { number } over number.Note also the invocation emitter(END). We use this to notify any channel consumer that the channel has been closed, meaning no other messages will come through this channel.Let's see how we can use this channel from our Saga. (This is taken from the cancellable-counter example in the repo.)import { take, put, call } from 'redux-saga/effects'\nimport { eventChannel, END } from 'redux-saga'\n\n// creates an event Channel from an interval of seconds\nfunction countdown(seconds) { ... }\n\nexport function* saga() {\n  const chan = yield call(countdown, value)\n  try {    \n    while (true) {\n      // take(END) will cause the saga to terminate by jumping to the finally block\n      let seconds = yield take(chan)\n      console.log(`countdown: ${seconds}`)\n    }\n  } finally {\n    console.log('countdown terminated')\n  }\n}\nSo the Saga is yielding a take(chan). This causes the Saga to block until a message is put on the channel. In our example above, it corresponds to when we invoke emitter(secs). Note also we're executing the whole while (true) {...} loop inside a try/finally block. When the interval terminates, the countdown function closes the event channel by invoking emitter(END). Closing a channel has the effect of terminating all Sagas blocked on a take from that channel. In our example, terminating the Saga will cause it to jump to its finally block (if provided, otherwise the Saga simply terminates).The subscriber returns an unsubscribe function. This is used by the channel to unsubscribe before the event source complete. Inside a Saga consuming messages from an event channel, if we want to exit early before the event source complete (e.g. Saga has been cancelled) you can call chan.close() to close the channel and unsubscribe from the source.For example, we can make our Saga support cancellation:import { take, put, call, cancelled } from 'redux-saga/effects'\nimport { eventChannel, END } from 'redux-saga'\n\n// creates an event Channel from an interval of seconds\nfunction countdown(seconds) { ... }\n\nexport function* saga() {\n  const chan = yield call(countdown, value)\n  try {    \n    while (true) {\n      let seconds = yield take(chan)\n      console.log(`countdown: ${seconds}`)\n    }\n  } finally {\n    if (yield cancelled()) {\n      chan.close()\n      console.log('countdown cancelled')\n    }    \n  }\n}\nHere is another example of how you can use event channels to pass WebSocket events into your saga (e.g.: using socket.io library).\nSuppose you are waiting for a server message ping then reply with a pong message after some delay.import { take, put, call, apply } from 'redux-saga/effects'\nimport { eventChannel, delay } from 'redux-saga'\nimport { createWebSocketConnection } from './socketConnection'\n\n// this function creates an event channel from a given socket\n// Setup subscription to incoming `ping` events\nfunction createSocketChannel(socket) {\n  // `eventChannel` takes a subscriber function\n  // the subscriber function takes an `emit` argument to put messages onto the channel\n  return eventChannel(emit => {\n\n    const pingHandler = (event) => {\n      // puts event payload into the channel\n      // this allows a Saga to take this payload from the returned channel\n      emit(event.payload)\n    }\n\n    // setup the subscription\n    socket.on('ping', pingHandler)\n\n    // the subscriber must return an unsubscribe function\n    // this will be invoked when the saga calls `channel.close` method\n    const unsubscribe = () => {\n      socket.off('ping', pingHandler)\n    }\n\n    return unsubscribe\n  })\n}\n\n// reply with a `pong` message by invoking `socket.emit('pong')`\nfunction* pong(socket) {\n  yield call(delay, 5000)\n  yield apply(socket, socket.emit, ['pong']) // call `emit` as a method with `socket` as context\n}\n\nexport function* watchOnPings() {\n  const socket = yield call(createWebSocketConnection)\n  const socketChannel = yield call(createSocketChannel, socket)\n\n  while (true) {\n    const payload = yield take(socketChannel)\n    yield put({ type: INCOMING_PONG_PAYLOAD, payload })\n    yield fork(pong, socket)\n  }\n}\nNote: messages on an eventChannel are not buffered by default. You have to provide a buffer to the eventChannel factory in order to specify buffering strategy for the channel (e.g. eventChannel(subscriber, buffer)).\nSee the API docs for more info.Using channels to communicate between SagasBesides action channels and event channels. You can also directly create channels which are not connected to any source by default. You can then manually put on the channel. This is handy when you want to use a channel to communicate between sagas.To illustrate, let's review the former example of request handling.import { take, fork, ... } from 'redux-saga/effects'\n\nfunction* watchRequests() {\n  while (true) {\n    const {payload} = yield take('REQUEST')\n    yield fork(handleRequest, payload)\n  }\n}\n\nfunction* handleRequest(payload) { ... }\nWe saw that the watch-and-fork pattern allows handling multiple requests simultaneously, without limit on the number of worker tasks executing concurrently. Then, we used the actionChannel effect to limit the concurrency to one task at a time.So let's say that our requirement is to have a maximum of three tasks executing at the same time. When we get a request and there are less than three tasks executing, we process the request immediately, otherwise we queue the task and wait for one of the three slots to become free.Below is an example of a solution using channels:import { channel } from 'redux-saga'\nimport { take, fork, ... } from 'redux-saga/effects'\n\nfunction* watchRequests() {\n  // create a channel to queue incoming requests\n  const chan = yield call(channel)\n\n  // create 3 worker 'threads'\n  for (var i = 0; i \nIn the above example, we create a channel using the channel factory. We get back a channel which by default buffers all messages we put on it (unless there is a pending taker, in which the taker is resumed immediately with the message).The watchRequests saga then forks three worker sagas. Note the created channel is supplied to all forked sagas. watchRequests will use this channel to dispatch work to the three worker sagas. On each REQUEST action the Saga will simply put the payload on the channel. The payload will then be taken by any free worker. Otherwise it will be queued by the channel until a worker Saga is ready to take it.All the three workers run a typical while loop. On each iteration, a worker will take the next request, or will block until a message is available. Note that this mechanism provides an automatic load-balancing between the 3 workers. Rapid workers are not slowed down by slow workers."},"recipes/":{"url":"recipes/","title":"레시피","keywords":"","body":"RecipesThrottlingYou can throttle a sequence of dispatched actions by using a handy built-in throttle helper. For example, suppose the UI fires an INPUT_CHANGED action while the user is typing in a text field.import { throttle } from 'redux-saga/effects'\n\nfunction* handleInput(input) {\n  // ...\n}\n\nfunction* watchInput() {\n  yield throttle(500, 'INPUT_CHANGED', handleInput)\n}\nBy using this helper the watchInput won't start a new handleInput task for 500ms, but in the same time it will still be accepting the latest INPUT_CHANGED actions into its underlaying buffer, so it'll miss all INPUT_CHANGED actions happening in-between. This ensures that the Saga will take at most one INPUT_CHANGED action during each period of 500ms and still be able to process trailing action.DebouncingTo debounce a sequence, put the built-in delay helper in the forked task:\nimport { delay } from 'redux-saga'\n\nfunction* handleInput(input) {\n  // debounce by 500ms\n  yield call(delay, 500)\n  ...\n}\n\nfunction* watchInput() {\n  let task\n  while (true) {\n    const { input } = yield take('INPUT_CHANGED')\n    if (task) {\n      yield cancel(task)\n    }\n    task = yield fork(handleInput, input)\n  }\n}\nThe delay function implements a simple debounce using a Promise.const delay = (ms) => new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, ms))\nIn the above example handleInput waits for 500ms before performing its logic. If the user types something during this period we'll get more INPUT_CHANGED actions. Since handleInput will still be blocked in the delay call, it'll be cancelled by watchInput before it can start performing its logic.Example above could be rewritten with redux-saga takeLatest helper:\nimport { delay } from 'redux-saga'\n\nfunction* handleInput({ input }) {\n  // debounce by 500ms\n  yield call(delay, 500)\n  ...\n}\n\nfunction* watchInput() {\n  // will cancel current running handleInput task\n  yield takeLatest('INPUT_CHANGED', handleInput);\n}\nRetrying XHR callsTo retry a XHR call for a specific amount of times, use a for loop with a delay:\nimport { delay } from 'redux-saga'\n\nfunction* updateApi(data) {\n  for(let i = 0; i \nIn the above example the apiRequest will be retried for 5 times, with a delay of 2 seconds in between. After the 5th failure, the exception thrown will get caught by the parent saga, which will dispatch the UPDATE_ERROR action.If you want unlimited retries, then the for loop can be replaced with a while (true). Also instead of take you can use takeLatest, so only the last request will be retried. By adding an UPDATE_RETRY action in the error handling, we can inform the user that the update was not successfull but it will be retried.import { delay } from 'redux-saga'\n\nfunction* updateApi(data) {\n  while (true) {\n    try {\n      const apiResponse = yield call(apiRequest, { data });\n      return apiResponse;\n    } catch(error) {\n      yield put({\n        type: 'UPDATE_RETRY',\n        error\n      })\n      yield call(delay, 2000);\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nfunction* updateResource({ data }) {\n  const apiResponse = yield call(updateApi, data);\n  yield put({\n    type: 'UPDATE_SUCCESS',\n    payload: apiResponse.body,\n  });\n}\n\nexport function* watchUpdateResource() {\n  yield takeLatest('UPDATE_START', updateResource);\n}\n\nUndoThe ability to undo respects the user by allowing the action to happen smoothly\nfirst and foremost before assuming they don't know what they are doing. GoodUI\nThe redux documentation describes a\nrobust way to implement an undo based on modifying the reducer to contain past, present,\nand future state.  There is even a library redux-undo that\ncreates a higher order reducer to do most of the heavy lifting for the developer.However, this method comes with it overheard from storing references to the previous state(s) of the application.Using redux-saga's delay and race we can implement a simple, one-time undo without enhancing\nour reducer or storing the previous state.import { take, put, call, spawn, race } from 'redux-saga/effects'\nimport { delay } from 'redux-saga'\nimport { updateThreadApi, actions } from 'somewhere'\n\nfunction* onArchive(action) {\n\n  const { threadId } = action\n  const undoId = `UNDO_ARCHIVE_${threadId}`\n\n  const thread = { id: threadId, archived: true }\n\n  // show undo UI element, and provide a key to communicate\n  yield put(actions.showUndo(undoId))\n\n  // optimistically mark the thread as `archived`\n  yield put(actions.updateThread(thread))\n\n  // allow the user 5 seconds to perform undo.\n  // after 5 seconds, 'archive' will be the winner of the race-condition\n  const { undo, archive } = yield race({\n    undo: take(action => action.type === 'UNDO' && action.undoId === undoId),\n    archive: call(delay, 5000)\n  })\n\n  // hide undo UI element, the race condition has an answer\n  yield put(actions.hideUndo(undoId))\n\n  if (undo) {\n    // revert thread to previous state\n    yield put(actions.updateThread({ id: threadId, archived: false }))\n  } else if (archive) {\n    // make the API call to apply the changes remotely\n    yield call(updateThreadApi, thread)\n  }\n}\n\nfunction* main() {\n  while (true) {\n    // wait for an ARCHIVE_THREAD to happen\n    const action = yield take('ARCHIVE_THREAD')\n    // use spawn to execute onArchive in a non-blocking fashion, which also\n    // prevents cancelation when main saga gets cancelled.\n    // This helps us in keeping state in sync between server and client\n    yield spawn(onArchive, action)\n  }\n}\n"},"ExternalResources.html":{"url":"ExternalResources.html","title":"External Resources","keywords":"","body":"External ResourcesArticles on GeneratorsThe Definitive Guide to the JavaScript Generators by Gajus Kuizinas\n\nThe Basics Of ES6 Generators by Kyle Simpson\n\nES6 generators in depth by Axel Rauschmayer\n\nArticles on redux-sagaRedux nowadays: From actions creators to sagas by Riad Benguella\n\nManaging Side Effects In React + Redux Using Sagas by Jack Hsu\n\nUsing redux-saga To Simplify Your Growing React Native Codebase by Steve Kellock\n\nMaster Complex Redux Workflows with Sagas by Brandon Konkle\n\nHandling async in Redux with Sagas by Niels Gerritsen\n\nTips to handle Authentication in Redux by Mattia Manzati\n\nBuild an Image Gallery Using React, Redux and redux-saga by Joel Hooks\n\nAsync Operations using redux saga by Andrés Mijares\n\nIntroduction to Redux Saga by Matt Granmoe\n\nVuex meets Redux-saga by Illya Klymov\n\nAddonsredux-saga-sc – Provides sagas to easily dispatch redux actions over SocketCluster websockets\n\nredux-form-saga – An action creator and saga for integrating Redux Form and Redux Saga\n\nredux-electron-enhancer – Redux store which synchronizes between instances in multiple process\n\neslint-plugin-redux-saga - ESLint rules that help you to write error free sagas\n\nredux-saga-router - Helper for running sagas in response to route changes.\n\nvuex-redux-saga - Bridge between Vuex and Redux-Saga\n\n"},"Troubleshooting.html":{"url":"Troubleshooting.html","title":"Troubleshooting","keywords":"","body":"TroubleshootingApp freezes after adding a sagaMake sure that you yield the effects from the generator function.Consider this example:import { take } from 'redux-saga/effects'\n\nfunction* logActions() {\n  while (true) {\n    const action = take() // wrong\n    console.log(action)\n  }\n}\nIt will put the application into an infinite loop because take() only creates a description of the effect. Unless you yield it for the middleware to execute, the while loop will behave like a regular while loop, and freeze your application.Adding yield will pause the generator and return control to the Redux Saga middleware which will execute the effect. In case of take(), Redux Saga will wait for the next action matching the pattern, and only then will resume the generator.To fix the example above, simply yield the effect returned by take():import { take } from 'redux-saga/effects'\n\nfunction* logActions() {\n  while (true) {\n    const action = yield take() // correct\n    console.log(action)\n  }\n}\nMy Saga is missing dispatched actionsMake sure the Saga is not blocked on some effect. When a Saga is waiting for an Effect to\nresolve, it will not be able to take dispatched actions until the Effect is resolved.For example, consider this examplefunction watchRequestActions() {\n  while (true) {\n    const {url, params} = yield take('REQUEST')\n    yield call(handleRequestAction, url, params) // The Saga will block here\n  }\n}\n\nfunction handleRequestAction(url, params) {\n  const response = yield call(someRemoteApi, url, params)\n  yield put(someAction(response))\n}\nWhen watchRequestActions performs yield call(handleRequestAction, url, params), it'll wait\nfor handleRequestAction until it terminates an returns before continuing on the next\nyield take.

For example you use\ncall(myfunc, 'arg1', 'arg2') to instruct the middleware to invoke myfunc('arg1', 'arg2') and return\nthe result back to the Generator that yielded the effectTaskA task is like a process running in background. In a redux-saga based application there can be\nmultiple tasks running in parallel. You create tasks by using the fork functionfunction* saga() {\n  ...\n  const task = yield fork(otherSaga, ...args)\n  ...\n}\nBlocking/Non-blocking callA Blocking call means that the Saga yielded an Effect and will wait for the outcome of its execution before\nresuming to the next instruction inside the yielding Generator.A Non-blocking call means that the Saga will resume immediately after yielding the Effect.For examplefunction* saga() {\n  yield take(ACTION)              // Blocking: will wait for the action\n  yield call(ApiFn, ...args)      // Blocking: will wait for ApiFn (If ApiFn returns a Promise)\n  yield call(otherSaga, ...args)  // Blocking: will wait for otherSaga to terminate\n\n  yield put(...)                   // Non-Blocking: will dispatch within internal scheduler\n\n  const task = yield fork(otherSaga, ...args)  // Non-blocking: will not wait for otherSaga\n  yield cancel(task)                           // Non-blocking: will resume immediately\n  // or\n  yield join(task)                              // Blocking: will wait for the task to terminate\n}\nWatcher/Workerrefers to a way of organizing the control flow using two separate SagasThe watcher: will watch for dispatched actions and fork a worker on every action\nThe worker: will handle the action and terminate\nexamplefunction* watcher() {\n  while (true) {\n    const action = yield take(ACTION)\n    yield fork(worker, action.payload)\n  }\n}\n\nfunction* worker(payload) {\n  // ... do some stuff\n}\n"},"api/":{"url":"api/","title":"API Reference","keywords":"","body":"API ReferenceMiddleware APIcreateSagaMiddleware(options)\n\nmiddleware.run(saga, ...args)\n\n\nSaga HelperstakeEvery(pattern, saga, ...args)\n\ntakeLatest(pattern, saga, ..args)\n\nthrottle(ms, pattern, saga, ..args)\n\n\nEffect creatorstake(pattern)\n\ntake.maybe(pattern)\n\ntake(channel)\n\ntake.maybe(channel)\n\nput(action)\n\nput.resolve(action)\n\nput(channel, action)\n\ncall(fn, ...args)\n\ncall([context, fn], ...args)\n\napply(context, fn, args)\n\ncps(fn, ...args)\n\ncps([context, fn], ...args)\n\nfork(fn, ...args)\n\nfork([context, fn], ...args)\n\nspawn(fn, ...args)\n\nspawn([context, fn], ...args)\n\njoin(task)\n\njoin(...tasks)\n\ncancel(task)\n\ncancel(...tasks)\n\ncancel()\n\nselect(selector, ...args)\n\nactionChannel(pattern, [buffer])\n\nflush(channel)\n\ncancelled()\n\n\nEffect combinatorsrace(effects)\n\n[...effects] (aka parallel effects)\n\n\nInterfacesTask\n\nChannel\n\nBuffer\n\nSagaMonitor\n\n\nExternal APIrunSaga(iterator, options)\n\n\nUtilschannel([buffer])\n\neventChannel(subscribe, [buffer], matcher)\n\nbuffers\n\ndelay(ms, [val])\n\ncloneableGenerator(generatorFunc)\n\ncreateMockTask()\n\n\nCheatsheetsBlocking / Non-blocking\n\nMiddleware APIcreateSagaMiddleware(options)Creates a Redux middleware and connects the Sagas to the Redux Storeoptions: Object - A list of options to pass to the middleware. Currently supported options are:sagaMonitor : SagaMonitor - If a Saga Monitor is provided, the middleware will deliver monitoring events to the monitor.\nemitter : Used to feed actions from redux to redux-saga (through redux middleware). Emitter is a higher order function, which takes a builtin emitter and returns another emitter.ExampleIn the following example we create an emitter which \"unpacks\" array of actions and emits individual actions extracted from the array. createSagaMiddleware({\n   emitter: emit => action => {\n    if (Array.isArray(action)) {\n      action.forEach(emit);\n      return\n    }\n    emit(action);\n   }\n });\nlogger : Function -  defines a custom logger for the middleware. By default, the middleware logs all errors and\nwarnings to the console. This option tells the middleware to send errors/warnings to the provided logger instead. The logger is called with the params (level, ...args). The 1st indicates the level of the log ('info', 'warning' or 'error'). The rest corresponds to the following arguments (You can use args.join(' ') to concatenate all args into a single StringS).\n\n\nonError : Function - if provided, the middleware will call it with uncaught errors from Sagas. useful for sending uncaught exceptions to error tracking services.\n\nExampleBelow we will create a function configureStore which will enhance the Store with a new method runSaga. Then in our main module, we will use the method to start the root Saga of the application.configureStore.jsimport createSagaMiddleware from 'redux-saga'\nimport reducer from './path/to/reducer'\n\nexport default function configureStore(initialState) {\n  // Note: passing middleware as the last argument to createStore requires redux@>=3.1.0\n  const sagaMiddleware = createSagaMiddleware()\n  return {\n    ...createStore(reducer, initialState, applyMiddleware(/* other middleware, */sagaMiddleware)),\n    runSaga: sagaMiddleware.run\n  }\n}\nmain.jsimport configureStore from './configureStore'\nimport rootSaga from './sagas'\n// ... other imports\n\nconst store = configureStore()\nstore.runSaga(rootSaga)\nNotesSee below for more information on the sagaMiddleware.run method.middleware.run(saga, ...args)Dynamically run saga. Can be used to run Sagas only after the applyMiddleware phase.saga: Function: a Generator function\n\nargs: Array: arguments to be provided to saga\n\nThe method returns a Task descriptor.Notessaga must be a function which returns a Generator Object. The middleware will then iterate over the Generator and execute all yielded Effects.saga may also start other sagas using the various Effects provided by the library. The iteration process process described below is also applied to all child sagas.In the first iteration, the middleware invokes the next() method to retrieve the next Effect. The middleware then executes the yielded Effect as specified by the Effects API below. Meanwhile, the Generator will be suspended until the effect execution terminates. Upon receiving the result of the execution, the middleware calls next(result) on the Generator passing it the retrieved result as an argument. This process is repeated until the Generator terminates normally or by throwing some error.If the execution results in an error (as specified by each Effect creator) then the throw(error) method of the Generator is called instead. If the Generator function defines a try/catch surrounding the current yield instruction, then the catch block will be invoked by the underlying Generator runtime. The runtime will also invoke any corresponding finally block.In the case a Saga is cancelled (either manually or using the provided Effects), the middleware will invoke return() method of the Generator. This will cause the Generator to skip directly to the finally block.Saga HelpersNote: the following functions are helper functions built on top of the Effect creators\nbelow.takeEvery(pattern, saga, ...args)Spawns a saga on each action dispatched to the Store that matches pattern.pattern: String | Array | Function - for more information see docs for take(pattern)\nsaga: Function - a Generator function\nargs: Array - arguments to be passed to the started task. takeEvery will add the incoming action to the argument list (i.e. the action will be the last argument provided to saga)\nExampleIn the following example, we create a simple task fetchUser. We use takeEvery to start a new fetchUser task on each dispatched USER_REQUESTED action:import { takeEvery } from `redux-saga/effects`\n\nfunction* fetchUser(action) {\n  ...\n}\n\nfunction* watchFetchUser() {\n  yield takeEvery('USER_REQUESTED', fetchUser)\n}\nNotestakeEvery is a high-level API built using take and fork. Here is how the helper could be implemented using the low-level Effectsfunction* takeEvery(pattern, saga, ...args) {\n  const task = yield fork(function* () {\n    while (true) {\n      const action = yield take(pattern)\n      yield fork(saga, ...args.concat(action))\n    }\n  })\n  return task\n}\ntakeEvery allows concurrent actions to be handled. In the example above, when a USER_REQUESTED\naction is dispatched, a new fetchUser task is started even if a previous fetchUser is still pending\n(for example, the user clicks on a Load User button 2 consecutive times at a rapid rate, the 2nd\nclick will dispatch a USER_REQUESTED action while the fetchUser fired on the first one hasn't yet terminated)takeEvery doesn't handle out of order responses from tasks. There is no guarantee that the tasks will\ntermiate in the same order they were started. To handle out of order responses, you may consider takeLatest\nbelow.takeLatest(pattern, saga, ...args)Spawns a saga on each action dispatched to the Store that matches pattern. And automatically cancels\nany previous saga task started previous if it's still running.Each time an action is dispatched to the store. And if this action matches pattern, takeLatest\nstarts a new saga task in the background. If a saga task was started previously (on the last action dispatched\nbefore the actual action), and if this task is still running, the task will be cancelled.pattern: String | Array | Function - for more information see docs for take(pattern)\nsaga: Function - a Generator function\nargs: Array - arguments to be passed to the started task. takeLatest will add the\nincoming action to the argument list (i.e. the action will be the last argument provided to saga)\nExampleIn the following example, we create a simple task fetchUser. We use takeLatest to\nstart a new fetchUser task on each dispatched USER_REQUESTED action. Since takeLatest\ncancels any pending task started previously, we ensure that if a user triggers multiple consecutive\nUSER_REQUESTED actions rapidly, we'll only conclude with the latest actionimport { takeLatest } from `redux-saga/effects`\n\nfunction* fetchUser(action) {\n  ...\n}\n\nfunction* watchLastFetchUser() {\n  yield takeLatest('USER_REQUESTED', fetchUser)\n}\nNotestakeLatest is a high-level API built using take and fork. Here is how the helper could be implemented using the low-level Effectsfunction* takeLatest(pattern, saga, ...args) {\n  const task = yield fork(function* () {\n    let lastTask\n    while (true) {\n      const action = yield take(pattern)\n      if (lastTask)\n        yield cancel(lastTask) // cancel is no-op if the task has already terminated\n\n      lastTask = yield fork(saga, ...args.concat(action))\n    }\n  })\n  return task\n}\nthrottle(ms, pattern, saga, ...args)Spawns a saga on an action dispatched to the Store that matches pattern. After spawning a task it's still accepting incoming actions into the underlaying buffer, keeping at most 1 (the most recent one), but in the same time holding up with spawning new task for ms miliseconds (hence it's name - throttle). Purpose of this is to ignore incoming actions for a given period of time while processing a task.ms: Number - length of a time window in miliseconds during which actions will be ignored after the action starts processing\npattern: String | Array | Function - for more information see docs for take(pattern)\nsaga: Function - a Generator function\nargs: Array - arguments to be passed to the started task. throttle will add the\nincoming action to the argument list (i.e. the action will be the last argument provided to saga)\nExampleIn the following example, we create a simple task fetchAutocomplete. We use throttle to\nstart a new fetchAutocomplete task on dispatched FETCH_AUTOCOMPLETE action. However since throttle ignores consecutive FETCH_AUTOCOMPLETE for some time, we ensure that user won't flood our server with requests.import { throttle } from `redux-saga/effects`\n\nfunction* fetchAutocomplete(action) {\n  const autocompleteProposals = yield call(Api.fetchAutocomplete, action.text)\n  yield put({type: 'FETCHED_AUTOCOMPLETE_PROPOSALS', proposals: autocompleteProposals})\n}\n\nfunction* throttleAutocomplete() {\n  yield throttle(1000, 'FETCH_AUTOCOMPLETE', fetchAutocomplete)\n}\nNotesthrottle is a high-level API built using take, fork and actionChannel. Here is how the helper could be implemented using the low-level Effectsfunction* throttle(ms, pattern, task, ...args) {\n  const throttleChannel = yield actionChannel(pattern, buffers.sliding(1))\n\n  while (true) {\n    const action = yield take(throttleChannel)\n    yield fork(task, ...args, action)\n    yield call(delay, ms)\n  }\n}\nEffect creatorsNotes:Each function below returns a plain JavaScript object and does not perform any execution.\n\nThe execution is performed by the middleware during the Iteration process described above.\n\nThe middleware examines each Effect description and performs the appropriate action.\n\ntake(pattern)Creates an Effect description that instructs the middleware to wait for a specified action on the Store.\nThe Generator is suspended until an action that matches pattern is dispatched.pattern is interpreted using the following rules:If take is called with no arguments or '*' all dispatched actions are matched (e.g. take() will match all actions)\nIf it is a function, the action is matched if pattern(action) is true (e.g. take(action => action.entities) will match all actions having a (truthy) entitiesfield.)Note: if the pattern function has toString defined on it, action.type will be tested against pattern.toString() instead. This is useful if you're using an action creator library like redux-act or redux-actions.\nIf it is a String, the action is matched if action.type === pattern (e.g. take(INCREMENT_ASYNC)\nIf it is an array, each item in the array is matched with beforementioned rules, so the mixed array of strings and function predicates is supported. The most common use case is an array of strings though, so that action.type is matched against all items in the array (e.g. take([INCREMENT, DECREMENT]) and that would match either actions of type INCREMENT or DECREMENT).\nThe middleware provides a special action END. If you dispatch the END action, then all Sagas blocked on a take Effect will be terminated regardless of the specified pattern. If the terminated Saga has still some forked tasks which are still running, it will wait for all the child tasks to terminate before terminating the Task.take.maybe(pattern)Same as take(pattern) but does not automatically terminate the Saga on an END action. Instead all Sagas blocked on a take Effect will get the END object.Notestake.maybe got it name from the FP analogy - it's like instead of having a return type of ACTION (with automatic handling) we can have a type of Maybe(ACTION) so we can handle both cases:case when there is a Just(ACTION) (we have an action)\n\nthe case of NOTHING (channel was closed*). i.e. we need some way to map over END\ninternally all dispatched actions are going through the stdChannel which is geting closed when dispatch(END) happens\ntake(channel)Creates an Effect description that instructs the middleware to wait for a specified message from the provided Channel. If the channel is already closed, then the Generator will immediately terminate following the same process described above for take(pattern).take.maybe(channel)Same as take(channel) but does not automatically terminate the Saga on an END action. Instead all Sagas blocked on a take Effect will get the END object. See more hereput(action)Creates an Effect description that instructs the middleware to dispatch an action to the Store.\nThis effect is non-blocking and any errors that are thrown downstream (e.g. in a reducer) will\nnot bubble back into the saga.action: Object - see Redux dispatch documentation for complete info\n\nput.resolve(action)Just like put but the effect is blocking (if promise is returned from dispatch it will wait for its resolution) and will bubble up errors from downstream.action: Object - see Redux dispatch documentation for complete info\n\nput(channel, action)Creates an Effect description that instructs the middleware to put an action into the provided channel.channel: Channel - a Channel Object.\n\naction: Object - see Redux dispatch documentation for complete info\n\nThis effect is blocking if the put is not buffered but immediately consumed by takers. If an error\nis thrown in any of these takers it will bubble back into the saga.call(fn, ...args)Creates an Effect description that instructs the middleware to call the function fn with args as arguments.fn: Function - A Generator function, or normal function which either returns a Promise as result, or any other value.\nargs: Array - An array of values to be passed as arguments to fn\nNotesfn can be either a normal or a Generator function.The middleware invokes the function and examines its result.If the result is an Iterator object, the middleware will run that Generator function, just like it did with the\nstartup Generators (passed to the middleware on startup). The parent Generator will be\nsuspended until the child Generator terminates normally, in which case the parent Generator\nis resumed with the value returned by the child Generator. Or until the child aborts with some\nerror, in which case an error will be thrown inside the parent Generator.If the result is a Promise, the middleware will suspend the Generator until the Promise is\nresolved, in which case the Generator is resumed with the resolved value. or until the Promise\nis rejected, in which case an error is thrown inside the Generator.If the result is not an Iterator object nor a Promise, the middleware will immediately return that value back to the saga,\nso that it can resume its execution synchronously.When an error is thrown inside the Generator. If it has a try/catch block surrounding the\ncurrent yield instruction, the control will be passed to the catch block. Otherwise,\nthe Generator aborts with the raised error, and if this Generator was called by another\nGenerator, the error will propagate to the calling Generator.call([context, fn], ...args)Same as call(fn, ...args) but supports passing a this context to fn. This is useful to\ninvoke object methods.apply(context, fn, [args])Alias for call([context, fn], ...args).cps(fn, ...args)Creates an Effect description that instructs the middleware to invoke fn as a Node style function.fn: Function - a Node style function. i.e. a function which accepts in addition to its arguments,\nan additional callback to be invoked by fn when it terminates. The callback accepts two parameters,\nwhere the first parameter is used to report errors while the second is used to report successful results\nargs: Array - an array to be passed as arguments for fn\nNotesThe middleware will perform a call fn(...arg, cb). The cb is a callback passed by the middleware to\nfn. If fn terminates normally, it must call cb(null, result) to notify the middleware\nof a successful result. If fn encounters some error, then it must call cb(error) in order to\nnotify the middleware that an error has occurred.The middleware remains suspended until fn terminates.cps([context, fn], ...args)Supports passing a this context to fn (object method invocation)fork(fn, ...args)Creates an Effect description that instructs the middleware to perform a non-blocking call on fnArgumentsfn: Function - A Generator function, or normal function which returns a Promise as result\nargs: Array - An array of values to be passed as arguments to fn\nreturns a Task object.Notefork, like call, can be used to invoke both normal and Generator functions. But, the calls are\nnon-blocking, the middleware doesn't suspend the Generator while waiting for the result of fn.\nInstead as soon as fn is invoked, the Generator resumes immediately.fork, alongside race, is a central Effect for managing concurrency between Sagas.The result of yield fork(fn ...args) is a Task object.  An object with some useful\nmethods and properties.All forked tasks are attached to their parents. When the parent terminates the execution of its\nown body of instructions, it will wait for all forked tasks to terminate before returning.Errors from child tasks automatically bubble up to their parents. If any forked task raises an uncaught error, then\nthe parent task will abort with the child Error, and the whole Parent's execution tree (i.e. forked tasks + the\nmain task represented by the parent's body if it's still running) will be cancelled.Cancellation of a forked Task will automatically cancel all forked tasks that are still executing. It'll\nalso cancel the current Effect where the cancelled task was blocked (if any).If a forked task fails synchronously (ie: fails immediately after its execution before performing any\nasync operation), then no Task is returned, instead the parent will be aborted as soon as possible (since both\nparent and child executes in parallel, the parent will abort as soon as it takes notice of the child failure).To create detached forks, use spawn instead.fork([context, fn], ...args)Supports invoking forked functions with a this contextspawn(fn, ...args)Same as fork(fn, ...args) but creates a detached task. A detached task remains independent from its parent and acts like\na top-level task. The parent will not wait for detached tasks to terminate before returning and all events which may affect the\nparent or the detached task are completely independents (error, cancellation).spawn([context, fn], ...args)Supports spawning functions with a this contextjoin(task)Creates an Effect description that instructs the middleware to wait for the result\nof a previously forked task.task: Task - A Task object returned by a previous fork\n\nNotesjoin will resolve to the same outcome of the joined task (success or error). If the joined\nthe task is cancelled, the cancellation will also propagate to the Saga executing the join effect\neffect. Similarly, any potential callers of those joiners will be cancelled as well.join(...tasks)Creates an Effect description that instructs the middleware to wait for the results of previously forked tasks.tasks: Array - A Task is the object returned by a previous fork\n\nNotesIt simply wraps automatically array of tasks in join effects, so it becomes roughly equivalent of yield tasks.map(t => join(t)).cancel(task)Creates an Effect description that instructs the middleware to cancel a previously forked task.task: Task - A Task object returned by a previous fork\n\nNotesTo cancel a running task, the middleware will invoke return on the underlying Generator\nobject. This will cancel the current Effect in the task and jump to the finally block (if defined).Inside the finally block, you can execute any cleanup logic or dispatch some action to keep the\nstore in a consistent state (e.g. reset the state of a spinner to false when an ajax request\nis cancelled). You can check inside the finally block if a Saga was cancelled by issuing\na yield cancelled().Cancellation propagates downward to child sagas. When cancelling a task, the middleware will also\ncancel the current Effect (where the task is currently blocked). If the current Effect\nis a call to another Saga, it will be also cancelled. When cancelling a Saga, all attached\nforks (sagas forked using yield fork()) will be cancelled. This means that cancellation\neffectively affects the whole execution tree that belongs to the cancelled task.cancel is a non-blocking Effect. i.e. the Saga executing it will resume immediately after\nperforming the cancellation.For functions which return Promise results, you can plug your own cancellation logic\nby attaching a [CANCEL] to the promise.The following example shows how to attach cancellation logic to a Promise result:import { CANCEL } from 'redux-saga'\nimport { fork, cancel } from 'redux-saga/effects'\n\nfunction myApi() {\n  const promise = myXhr(...)\n\n  promise[CANCEL] = () => myXhr.abort()\n  return promise\n}\n\nfunction* mySaga() {\n\n  const task = yield fork(myApi)\n\n  // ... later\n  // will call promise[CANCEL] on the result of myApi\n  yield cancel(task)\n}\ncancel(...tasks)Creates an Effect description that instructs the middleware to cancel previously forked tasks.tasks: Array - A Task is the object returned by a previous fork\n\nNotesIt simply wraps automatically array of tasks in cancel effects, so it becomes roughly equivalent of yield tasks.map(t => cancel(t)).cancel()Creates an Effect description that instructs the middleware to cancel a task in which it has been yielded (self cancellation).\nIt allows to reuse destructor-like logic inside a finally blocks for both outer (cancel(task)) and self (cancel()) cancellations.Examplefunction* deleteRecord({ payload }) {\n  try {\n    const { confirm, deny } = yield call(prompt);\n    if (confirm) {\n      yield put(actions.deleteRecord.confirmed())\n    }\n    if (deny) {\n      yield cancel()\n    }\n  } catch(e) {\n    // handle failure\n  } finally {\n    if (yield cancelled()) {\n      // shared cancellation logic\n      yield put(actions.deleteRecord.cancel(payload))\n    }\n  }\n}\nselect(selector, ...args)Creates an effect that instructs the middleware to invoke the provided selector on the\ncurrent Store's state (i.e. returns the result of selector(getState(), ...args)).selector: Function - a function (state, ...args) => args. It takes the\ncurrent state and optionally some arguments and returns a slice of the current Store's state\nargs: Array - optional arguments to be passed to the selector in addition of getState.\nIf select is called without argument (i.e. yield select()) then the effect is resolved\nwith the entire state (the same result of a getState() call).It's important to note that when an action is dispatched to the store, the middleware first\nforwards the action to the reducers and then notifies the Sagas. This means that when you query the\nStore's State, you get the State after the action has been applied.\nHowever, this behavior is only guaranteed if all subsequent middlewares call next(action) synchronously.  If any subsequent middleware calls next(action) asynchronously (which is unusual but possible), then the sagas will get the state from before the action is applied.  Therefore it is recommended to review the source of each subsequent middleware to ensure it calls next(action) synchronously, or else ensure that redux-saga is the last middleware in the call chain.NotesPreferably, a Saga should be autonomous and should not depend on the Store's state. This makes\nit easy to modify the state implementation without affecting the Saga code. A saga should preferably\ndepend only on its own internal control state when possible. But sometimes, one could\nfind it more convenient for a Saga to query the state instead of maintaining the needed data by itself\n(for example, when a Saga duplicates the logic of invoking some reducer to compute a state that was\nalready computed by the Store).For example, suppose we have this state shape in our application:state = {\n  cart: {...}\n}\nWe can create a selector, i.e. a function which knows how to extract the cart data from the State:./selectorsexport const getCart = state => state.cart\nThen we can use that selector from inside a Saga using the select Effect:./sagas.jsimport { take, fork, select } from 'redux-saga/effects'\nimport { getCart } from './selectors'\n\nfunction* checkout() {\n  // query the state using the exported selector\n  const cart = yield select(getCart)\n\n  // ... call some API endpoint then dispatch a success/error action\n}\n\nexport default function* rootSaga() {\n  while (true) {\n    yield take('CHECKOUT_REQUEST')\n    yield fork(checkout)\n  }\n}\ncheckout can get the needed information directly by using select(getCart). The Saga is coupled only with the getCart selector. If we have many Sagas (or React Components) that needs to access the cart slice, they will all be coupled to the same function getCart. And if we now change the state shape, we need only to update getCart.actionChannel(pattern, [buffer])Creates an effect that instructs the middleware to queue the actions matching pattern using an event channel. Optionally, you can provide a buffer to control buffering of the queued actions.pattern: - see API for take(pattern)\nbuffer: Buffer - a Buffer objectExampleThe following code creates channel to buffer all USER_REQUEST actions. Note that even the Saga maybe blocked\non the call effect. All actions that come while it's blocked are automatically buffered. This causes the Saga\nto execute the API calls one at a timeimport { actionChannel, call } from 'redux-saga/effects'\nimport api from '...'\n\nfunction* takeOneAtMost() {\n  const chan = yield actionChannel('USER_REQUEST')\n  while (true) {\n    const {payload} = yield take(chan)\n    yield call(api.getUser, payload)\n  }\n}\nflush(channel)Creates an effect that instructs the middleware to flush all buffered items from the channel. Flushed items are returned back to the saga, so they can be utilized if needed.channel: Channel - a Channel Object.\n\nExample\nfunction* saga() {\n  const chan = yield actionChannel('ACTION')\n\n  try {\n    while (true) {\n      const action = yield take(chan)\n      // ...\n    }\n  } finally {\n    const actions = yield flush(chan)\n    // ...\n  }\n\n}\ncancelled()Creates an effect that instructs the middleware to return whether this generator has been cancelled. Typically\nyou use this Effect in a finally block to run Cancellation specific codeExample\nfunction* saga() {\n  try {\n    // ...\n  } finally {\n    if (yield cancelled()) {\n      // logic that should execute only on Cancellation\n    }\n    // logic that should execute in all situations (e.g. closing a channel)\n  }\n}\nEffect combinatorsrace(effects)Creates an Effect description that instructs the middleware to run a Race between\nmultiple Effects (this is similar to how Promise.race([...]) behaves).effects: Object - a dictionary Object of the form {label: effect, ...}ExampleThe following example runs a race between two effects:A call to a function fetchUsers which returns a Promise\n\nA CANCEL_FETCH action which may be eventually dispatched on the Store\n\nimport { take, call, race } from `redux-saga/effects`\nimport fetchUsers from './path/to/fetchUsers'\n\nfunction* fetchUsersSaga {\n  const { response, cancel } = yield race({\n    response: call(fetchUsers),\n    cancel: take(CANCEL_FETCH)\n  })\n}\nIf call(fetchUsers) resolves (or rejects) first, the result of race will be an object\nwith a single keyed object {response: result} where result is the resolved result of fetchUsers.If an action of type CANCEL_FETCH is dispatched on the Store before fetchUsers completes, the result\nwill be a single keyed object {cancel: action}, where action is the dispatched action.NotesWhen resolving a race, the middleware automatically cancels all the losing Effects.[...effects] (parallel effects)Creates an Effect description that instructs the middleware to run multiple Effects\nin parallel and wait for all of them to complete.ExampleThe following example runs two blocking calls in parallel:import { fetchCustomers, fetchProducts } from './path/to/api'\n\nfunction* mySaga() {\n  const [customers, products] = yield [\n    call(fetchCustomers),\n    call(fetchProducts)\n  ]\n}\nNotesWhen running Effects in parallel, the middleware suspends the Generator until one of the following occurs:All the Effects completed with success: resumes the Generator with an array containing the results of all Effects.\nOne of the Effects was rejected before all the effects complete: throws the rejection error inside the Generator.\nInterfacesTaskThe Task interface specifies the result of running a Saga using fork, middleware.run or runSaga.\n  \n    method\n    return value\n  \n  \n    task.isRunning()\n    true if the task hasn't yet returned or thrown an error\n  \n  \n    task.isCancelled()\n    true if the task has been cancelled\n  \n  \n    task.result()\n    task return value. `undefined` if task is still running\n  \n  \n    task.error()\n    task thrown error. `undefined` if task is still running\n  \n  \n    task.done\n    \n      a Promise which is either:\n        \n          resolved with task's return value\n          rejected with task's thrown error\n        \n      \n  \n  \n    task.cancel()\n    Cancels the task (If it is still running)\n  \n\n\n\n\nChannelA channel is an object used to send and receive messages between tasks. Messages from senders are queued until an interested receiver request a message, and registered receiver is queued until a message is available.Every channel has an underlying buffer which defines the buffering strategy (fixed size, dropping, sliding)The Channel interface defines 3 methods: take, put and closeChannel.take(callback): used to register a taker. The take is resolved using the following rulesIf the channel has buffered messages, then callback will be invoked with the next message from the underlying buffer (using buffer.take())\n\nIf the channel is closed and there are no buffered messages, then callback is invoked with END\n\nOtherwisecallback will be queued until a message is put into the channel\n\nChannel.put(message): Used to put message on the buffer. The put will be handled using the following rulesIf the channel is closed, then the put will have no effect.\n\nIf there are pending takers, then invoke the oldest taker with the message.\n\nOtherwise put the message on the underlying buffer\n\nChannel.flush(callback): Used to extract all buffered messages from the channel. The flush is resolved using the following rulesIf the channel is closed and there are no buffered messages, then callback is invoked with END\n\nOtherwise callback is invoked with all buffered messages.\n\nChannel.close(): closes the channel which means no more puts will be allowed. All pending takers will be invoked with END.BufferUsed to implement the buffering strategy for a channel. The Buffer interface defines 3 methods: isEmpty, put and takeisEmpty(): returns true if there are no messages on the buffer. A channel calls this method whenever a new taker is registered\n\nput(message): used to put new message in the buffer. Note the Buffer can chose to not store the message\n(e.g. a dropping buffer can drop any new message exceeding a given limit)\n\ntake() used to retrieve any buffered message. Note the behavior of this method has to be consistent with isEmpty\n\nSagaMonitorUsed by the middleware to dispatch monitoring events. Actually the middleware dispatches 5 events:When an effect is triggered (via yield someEffect) the middleware invokes sagaMonitor.effectTriggered\nIf the effect is resolved with success the middleware invokes sagaMonitor.effectResolved\nIf the effect is rejected with an error the middleware invokes sagaMonitor.effectRejected\nIf the effect is cancelled the middleware invokes sagaMonitor.effectCancelled\nFinally, the middleware invokes sagaMonitor.actionDispatched when a Redux action is dispatched.\nBelow the signature for each methodeffectTriggered(options) : where options is an object with the following fieldseffectId : Number - Unique ID assigned to the yielded effect\nparentEffectId : Number - ID of the parent Effect. In the case of a race or parallel effect, all\neffects yielded inside will have the direct race/parallel effect as a parent. In case of a top-level effect, the\nparent will be the containing Saga\nlabel : String - In case of a race effect, all child effects will be assigned as label the corresponding\nkeys of the object passed to race\neffect : Object - the yielded effect itself\n\neffectResolved(effectId, result)effectId : Number - The ID of the yielded effect\nresult : any - The result of the successful resolution of the effect. In case of fork or spawn effects,\nthe result will be a Task object.\n\neffectRejected(effectId, error)effectId : Number - The ID of the yielded effect\nerror : any - Error raised with the rejection of the effect\n\neffectCancelled(effectId)effectId : Number - The ID of the yielded effect\n\n\nactionDispatched(action)action : Object - The dispatched Redux action. If the action was dispatched by a Saga\nthen the action will have a property SAGA_ACTION set to true (SAGA_ACTION can be imported from\nredux-saga/utils).\n\n\nExternal APIrunSaga(iterator, options)Allows starting sagas outside the Redux middleware environment. Useful if you want to\nconnect a Saga to external input/output, other than store actions.runSaga returns a Task object. Just like the one returned from a fork effect.iterator: {next, throw} - an Iterator object, Typically created by invoking a Generator function\noptions: Object - currently supported options are:subscribe(callback): Function - A function which accepts a callback and returns an unsubscribe functioncallback(input): Function - callback(provided by runSaga) used to subscribe to input events. subscribe must support registering multiple subscriptions.\ninput: any - argument passed by subscribe to callback (see Notes below)\n\n\n\n\ndispatch(output): Function - used to fulfill put effects.output: any -  argument provided by the Saga to the put Effect (see Notes below).\n\n\ngetState(): Function - used to fulfill select and getState effects\nsagaMonitor : SagaMonitor - see docs for createSagaMiddleware(options)\nlogger : Function - see docs for createSagaMiddleware(options)\nonError: Function - see docs for createSagaMiddleware(options)\nNotesThe {subscribe, dispatch} is used to fulfill take and put Effects. This defines the Input/Output\ninterface of the Saga.subscribe is used to fulfill take(PATTERN) effects. It must call callback every time it\nhas an input to dispatch (e.g. on every mouse click if the Saga is connected to DOM click events).\nEach time subscribe emits an input to its callbacks, if the Saga is blocked on a take effect, and\nif the take pattern matches the currently incoming input, the Saga is resumed with that input.dispatch is used to fulfill put effects. Each time the Saga emits a yield put(output), dispatch\nis invoked with output.Utilschannel([buffer])A factory method that can be used to create Channels. You can optionally pass it a buffer\nto control how the channel buffers the messages.By default, if no buffer is provided, the channel will queue incoming messages up to 10 until interested takers are registered. The default buffering will deliver message using a FIFO strategy: a new taker will be delivered the oldest message in the buffer.eventChannel(subscribe, [buffer], [matcher])Creates channel that will subscribe to an event source using the subscribe method. Incoming events from the event source will be queued in the channel until interested takers are registered.subscribe: Function used to subscribe to the underlying event source. The function must return an unsubscribe function to terminate the subscription.\nbuffer: Buffer optional Buffer object to buffer messages on this channel. If not provided messages will not buffered\non this channel.\nmatcher: Function optional predicate function (any => Boolean) to filter incoming messages. Only messages accepted by\nthe matcher will be put on the channel.\nTo notify the channel that the event source has terminated, you can notify the provided subscriber with an ENDExampleIn the following example we create an event channel that will subscribe to a setIntervalconst countdown = (secs) => {\n  return eventChannel(emitter => {\n      const iv = setInterval(() => {\n        console.log('countdown', secs)\n        secs -= 1\n        if (secs > 0) {\n          emitter(secs)\n        } else {\n          emitter(END)\n          clearInterval(iv)\n          console.log('countdown terminated')\n        }\n      }, 1000);\n      return () => {\n        clearInterval(iv)\n        console.log('countdown cancelled')\n      }\n    }\n  )\n}\nbuffersProvides some common buffersbuffers.none(): no buffering, new messages will be lost if there are no pending takers\nbuffers.fixed(limit): new messages will be buffered up to limit. Overflow will raises an Error. Omitting a limit value will result in a limit of 10.\nbuffers.expanding(initialSize): like fixed but Overflow will cause the buffer to expand dynamically.\nbuffers.dropping(limit): same as fixed but Overflow will silently drop the messages.\nbuffers.sliding(limit): same as fixed but Overflow will insert the new message at the end and drop the oldest message in the buffer.\ndelay(ms, [val])Returns a Promise that will resolve after ms milliseconds with val.cloneableGenerator(generatorFunc)Takes a generator function (function*) and returns a generator function.\nAll generators instanciated from this function will be cloneable.\nFor testing purpose only.ExampleThis is useful when you want to test different branch of a saga without having to replay the actions that lead to it.\nfunction* oddOrEven() {\n  // some stuff are done here\n  yield 1;\n  yield 2;\n  yield 3;\n\n  const userInput = yield 'enter a number';\n  if (userInput % 2 === 0) {\n    yield 'even';\n  } else {\n    yield 'odd'\n  }\n}\n\ntest('my oddOrEven saga', assert => {\n  const data = {};\n  data.gen = cloneableGenerator(oddOrEven)();\n\n  assert.equal(\n    data.gen.next().value,\n    1,\n    'it should yield 1'\n  );\n\n  assert.equal(\n    data.gen.next().value,\n    2,\n    'it should yield 2'\n  );\n\n  assert.equal(\n    data.gen.next().value,\n    3,\n    'it should yield 3'\n  );\n\n  assert.equal(\n    data.gen.next().value,\n    'enter a number',\n    'it should ask for a number'\n  );\n\n  assert.test('even number is given', a => {\n    // we make a clone of the generator before giving the number;\n    data.clone = data.gen.clone();\n\n    a.equal(\n      data.gen.next(2).value,\n      'even',\n      'it should yield \"event\"'\n    );\n\n    a.equal(\n      data.gen.next().done,\n      true,\n      'it should be done'\n    );\n\n    a.end();\n  });\n\n  assert.test('odd number is given', a => {\n\n    a.equal(\n      data.clone.next(1).value,\n      'odd',\n      'it should yield \"odd\"'\n    );\n\n    a.equal(\n      data.clone.next().done,\n      true,\n      'it should be done'\n    );\n\n    a.end();\n  });\n\n  assert.end();\n});\n\ncreateMockTask()Returns an object that mocks a task.\nFor testing purposes only.\nSee Task Cancellation docs for more information.\n)CheatsheetsBlocking / Non-blocking\n\nName\nBlocking\n\ntakeEvery\nNo\ntakeLatest\nNo\nthrottle\nNo\ntake\nYes\ntake(channel)\nSometimes (see API reference)\ntake.maybe\nYes\nput\nNo\nput.resolve\nYes\nput(channel, action)\nNo\ncall\nYes\napply\nYes\ncps\nYes\nfork\nNo\nspawn\nNo\njoin\nYes\ncancel\nYes\nselect\nNo\nactionChannel\nNo\nflush\nYes\ncancelled\nYes\nrace\nYes\n[...effects]\nBlocks only if there is a blocking effect in the array\n\n\n"}}}
